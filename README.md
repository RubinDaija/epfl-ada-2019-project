# Analysis of Sanitary Conditions in Chicago and Impacting Factors

# Abstract
Chicago is the third largest U.S. city, inhabiting around 2.7 million people. A population this large made it possible to give rise to over 7300 food facilities located in 77 community areas. Considering the high number of restaurants, can we comprehensively track the sanitary conditions these facilities? The goal of our project is to examine possible correlations, using the Chicago Food Inspections dataset. More precisely, the correlation between the facilityâ€™s sanitary conditions and their location. To develop our data story, we will use per capita income of each community area to gain further insight into the relation between the income level and restaurant sanitary conditions. This will be our main goal as we believe that restaurant quality will be correlated with the income of the community. Thus, if there is a community with a lower income the restaurants will need to accommodate accordingly by cutting costs, therefore lowering the sanitary standards. In addition, we will investigate different correlations relating to violation types.

# Research questions
* Is there any correlation between facility sanitary conditions and their geolocation?
* Does a community with a lower level of income result in facilities that are unsafe?
* Are the violations present also related to the location of the facility?

# Dataset
We will use the provided dataset called Chicago Food Inspections (https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-food-inspections). It is in a csv format and provides information such as violations, type of facility and location. We will augment this dataset by also using another dataset provided by the City of Chicago. This dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Per-Capita-Income/r6ad-wvtk) has information about per capita income for each of the communal areas. We believe we can use these two datasets combined to answer some of our research questions.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
* Clean up the dataset, dealing with incomplete data to deliver comprehensive dataset
* Find any correlation between location and facility conditions
* Fuse the two datasets together
* Write up a captivating story told by the dataset

# Questions for TAa
* What technologies could we use to show the correlation between location and facility sanitary quality in a map, and make it interactive.
