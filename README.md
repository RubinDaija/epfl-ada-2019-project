# Analysis of Sanitary Conditions in Chicago and Impacting Factors

# Abstract
Chicago is the third largest U.S. city which incorporates seventy-seven community areas. Over 7300 restaurants are located in these areas. The goal of our project is to investigate the inspection of food facilities in Chicago, using the Chicago Food Inspections dataset and examine possible correlations. More precisely, the correlation between the facilities sanitary conditions with their location will be examined. These facilities include restaurants, schools, gyms, etc. Provided that we find any correlation between location and sanitary quality, we will use per capita income to gain further insight into the relation between the income level and restaurant sanitary conditions, using a dataset provided by the city of Chicago for the income level of each community area. This is our main goal as we believe that restaurant quality will be dependent on the income of the community. Thus if there is a community with a lower income the restaurants will need to accommodate accordingly by cutting costs.  In addition to these we will also investigate different correlations relating to violation types.

# Research questions
* Is there any correlation between facility sanitary conditions and their geolocation?
* Does a community with a lower level of income result in facilities that are unsafe?
* Are the violations present also related to the location of the facility?

# Dataset
We will use the provided dataset called Chicago Food Inspections (https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-food-inspections). It is in a csv format and provides information such as violations, type of facility and location. We will augment this dataset by also using another dataset provided by the City of Chicago. This dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Per-Capita-Income/r6ad-wvtk) has information about per capita income for each of the communal areas. We believe we can use these two datasets combined to answer some of our research questions.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
* Clean up the dataset, dealing with incomplete data to deliver comprehensive dataset
* Find any correlation between location and facility conditions
* Fuse the two datasets together
* Write up a captivating story told by the dataset

# Questions for TAa
* What technologies could we use to show the correlation between location and facility sanitary quality in a map, and make it interactive.
