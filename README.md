# Visualization and Analysis of Food Facilities in Chicago 

# Abstract
The goal of our project is to examine possible correlations using the Chicago Food Inspections data set and look for hidden reasons why facilities go out of business. More precisely, the correlation between the inspection results of the facilities and their location. To develop our data story, we will utilize the many attributes of this data set, including facility type, pass rate of inspections, average risk score, and number of violations. This data set consists of over 31,000 food facilities in 77 community areas. We will answer questions such as 'Can we comprehensively track the conditions of these facilities?'. In addition, we will investigate different correlations relating to violation types. As a result we will visualize our findings in an understandable way. Our visualizations include displaying our results on the map of Chicago in order to find possible patterns (e.g. the locations of facilities that are out of order). Moreover, we will utilize various types of plots to show the characteristics of the data set. In the end, the reader will be able to understand the food sector in Chicago with its depth and with the possibility of opening a new facility based on our insight.

# Research questions
* Is there any correlation between facility conditions and their geolocation?
* Are the violations present related to the location of the facility?
* Is there a correlation between the type of violation a facility commits and going out of business?

# Data set
We will use the provided data set called Chicago Food Inspections (https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-food-inspections). It is in a csv format and provides information such as violations, type of facility, and location. 

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
* Clean up the dataset, dealing with incomplete data to deliver comprehensive dataset
* Find any correlation between location and facility conditions
* Fuse the two datasets together
* Write up a captivating story told by the dataset

# Questions for TAs
* What technologies could we use to show the correlation between location and facility sanitary quality in a map, and make it interactive?
